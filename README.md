## Using Linear Regression to predict AAPL (Apple Stock): Mockup
For this analysis, we will utilize a supervised machine learning model -- regression techniques -- in order to determine trends in Apple's stocket market price. Pulling data from Yahoo Finance, we will train and test our model to help predict stock prices for the next 30 days or more. The way we plan on approaching this is by filtering the data, first, by month, and then extracting data for the past 10 years.
