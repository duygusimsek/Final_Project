## Project Overview

For the University of Central Florida Data Analytics Bootcamp Project, our team has analyzed **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** ’s stock market prices for the last 10 years to help predict future prices and potential investigations. 

For that purpose, from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL) the dataset of [**Apple Inc. (AAPL)** ’s stock market prices](https://github.com/duygusimsek/Final_Project/blob/main/applestock.csv) for last year was downloaded and analyzed. 
 
The second stage of the analysis was creating a Machine Learning model that would predict these stock prices for the next 30 days.

## Analysis

The dataset that has been used for the project is provided by Yahoo! Finance. Yahoo! Finance provides financial news, relatively clean data, and commentary including stock quotes, financial reports, and original content. 

Through Yahoo! Finance, and Plotly we will be able to create visualizations that helped break down the AAPL stock market and its activity.

 The software can help forecast a time series, its built-in models are mainly used to recognize yearly, monthly, and daily seasonality; we will use this as an additive to our Machine Learning model. 



## Database 
For our database, we will be utilizing SQL, PgAdmin. We found the data on Yahoo Finance and downloaded the dataset as a CSV file.  We ran query in SQL to create and store the Apple_stock data found.  Please see image below for code and data output.

## Using Linear Regression to predict AAPL (Apple Stock): Mockup
For this analysis, we will utilize a supervised machine learning model -- regression techniques -- in order to determine trends in Apple's stock market price. Pulling data from Yahoo Finance, we will train and test our model to help predict stock prices for the next 30 days or more. The way we plan on approaching this is by filtering the data, first, by month, and then extracting data for the past 10 years.
