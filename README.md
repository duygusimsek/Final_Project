## Project Overview

For the University of Central Florida Data Analytics Bootcamp Project, our team has analyzed **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** ’s stock market prices for last year(?) to help predict future prices and potential investigations. 

For that purpose, from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL) the dataset of **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** ’s stock market prices for last year was downloaded (Add the dataset link here) and analyzed. 
 
The second stage of the analysis was creating a Machine Learning model that would predict these stock prices for the next 30 (?) days.
### Database 
For our database, we will be utilizing SQL, PgAdmin. We found the data on Yahoo Finance and downloaded the dataset as a CSV file.  We ran query in SQL to create and store the Apple_stock data found.  Please see imgae below for code and data output.
