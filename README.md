## Project Overview

For the University of Central Florida Data Analytics Bootcamp Project, our team has analyzed **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** ’s stock market prices for last year(?) to help predict future prices and potential investigations. 

For that purpose, from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL) the dataset of **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** ’s stock market prices for last year was downloaded (Add the dataset link here) and analyzed. 
 
The second stage of the analysis was creating a Machine Learning model that would predict these stock prices for the next 30 (?) days.

## Analysis

The dataset that has been used for the project is provided by Yahoo! Finance. Yahoo! Finance provides financial news, relatively clean data, and commentary including stock quotes, financial reports, and original content.
